<h1>About ME</h1>
<p>I'm Yun-Rou Lin, and I am now a grad student in University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign,
<br>I specialize in flood risk management and flood control, with a future focus on river pollution control. 
<br>Through my innovative projects and research, I aim to make a positive impact on the environment.</p>

       <p1>Flooding has become a persistent issue in the area due to the inadequate height of the levees. Every time it rains, water overflows the levees and floods nearby villages. While the authorities have decided not to build higher levees because of the relatively small population and the perception that flood-related losses are limited, local residents continue to suffer significant disruptions. Additionally, farmlands in the region are frequently affected by flooding, leading to crop damage and financial losses for the farmers.</p1>

      <p1>Wufang Village, a fishing community near the Donggang River, faces frequent flooding due to high tides and heavy rains. Its proximity to the shoreline worsens drainage conditions, especially during high tides, making the area vulnerable. Our team proposed solutions including pump stations, raised embankments, and automatic gates to prevent seawater inflow into fish ponds and city areas. My role involved simulating flood scenarios and analyzing potential solutions to guide decision-making. This experience reinforced my belief in the power of engineering to improve community resilience.</p1>
